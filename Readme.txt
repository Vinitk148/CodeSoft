Hello Everyone!
I have created 3 projects using python language and these projects are: 
1 - TicTacToe game
2 - Face Detection
3 - ChatBot with rule based.

In TicTacToe :-
-> I created a board with the help of dictionary.
-> Create two players as p1 and p2 and gives X & O respectively.
-> Then use some loops to check conditions if any player wins or the match tied.
-> Then it gives output according to conditions.

In Face Detection :-
-> I import cv2 library
-> Then I use CascadeClassifier to import a xml file.
-> Now I create a variable for video capture and read data.
-> now check if video capture or not, if not then program will break and exit.
-> Now set a size to captured video data and gives a colour to it
-> I set a key("q") to exit or close the camera.
-> Now we will run the code.

In ChatBot :-
-> I create variable in which I store some rules in dictionary form 
-> Then I create a function to gives response to user input in which
first use Lower() to convert upper case alphabet in lower case then 
use a loop and check if input match with rules key or not.
-> Then I create an another funtion to show output according to user input.
